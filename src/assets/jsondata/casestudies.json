Smart lighting systems often incorporate mesh networks, where each light bulb acts as a node that can relay commands to other bulbs. If one bulb fails or loses connectivity, nearby bulbs can still receive and execute commands, ensuring that the lighting automation remains functional. Scalability in this context allows homeowners to expand their smart lighting system easily by adding new bulbs to different rooms or areas of the house."
